# Guardian Media Analysis

## Project Overview

This project leverages The Guardian's API to extract and analyze articles about Justin Trudeau. The analysis covers articles from January 1, 2018, to the present day. The key tasks include counting the articles, determining the section with the most articles, visualizing the evolution of article counts over time, and identifying any unusual trends or events in the data.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains all source code for API extraction, data transformation, and reporting.
- `reports/`: Contains generated reports and visualizations.
- `archived/`: Stores archived data and notebooks.
- `logs/`: Contains logs generated by the system.
- `tests/`: Contains tests for the project modules.
- `config.ini`: Configuration settings for the project.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- VSCode with the Remote - Containers extension installed.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**: Ensure that you have the project repository cloned to your local machine or accessible within a remote development environment.

2. **Open the project in a DevContainer**:
   - Open VSCode.
   - Navigate to the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
   - Select "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container..."
   - Choose the project folder to open it within the DevContainer.

3. **Set environment variables**:
   Before running the project, set the necessary environment paths:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="/workspaces/GuardianApiAnalysis/guardian_media_analysis"
   ```

## Data Extraction and Initial Setup

- A `GuardianAPI` class has been implemented to manage the extraction of data from The Guardian API. This includes handling API connections, retrieving data, and organizing it into a DataFrame specifically filtered for Justin Trudeau-related articles.
- Comprehensive logging and error handling are in place, including exponential backoff and retries for API extraction failures.
- Logged data includes the number of rows extracted and exceptions encountered, enhancing traceability and debugging.

## Data Transformation and Visualization

- The `DataProcessor` class provides methods for detailed data analysis, including counting articles, identifying top sections, and detecting unusual events.
- Visualization is handled by the `DataVisualizer` class, which creates various plots to display the data, such as the evolution of article counts over time and the distribution of articles across different sections.
- These classes together enable a robust analysis pipeline from data extraction to reporting.

## Running the Project

To run the main analysis and generate reports:

1. Navigate to the `src/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/GuardianApiAnalysis/guardian_media_analysis/src
   ```

2. Run the main program, `main.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

This will execute the data extraction from The Guardian's API, perform analysis, and generate reports and visualizations based on the collected data.
